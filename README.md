# PythonCalculator
A calculator made with python, who would've guessed?

This was a piece of code that I wrote a long time ago. It was made entirely using the Python GUI framework: Tkinter.

The file source code can be found in the ```Tkinter Simple Calculator.py```. 

## Running the .exe
To run the calculator, go to ```dist->Tkinter Simple Calculator.exe```
